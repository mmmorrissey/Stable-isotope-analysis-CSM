## Stable-isotope-analysis-CSM

The data in this analysis was collected from zooplankton, algae, and sediments from freshwater ponds near a large seabird colony in Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland. The data were used for a Master's thesis project. Using the data, we explored if and how stable isotope signals were being transfered from seabirds (via droppings, feathers etc.) to the many freshwater ponds inland by wind. R Studio was used for the analysis.
